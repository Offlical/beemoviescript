# The Bee Movie Script Spammer
 A macro that spams the entire bee movie script.
# Why did you make this? 
i was bored and also wanted to bully someone on discord and then i invested too much time into it and made a user friendly version to cause chaos.
# How does this work?
The way this works is that you choose how much characters you want to be sent with each message, and how long do you want between each message to be sent. 
the way it sends the messages is by forcing your computer to click Ctrl+V, and then Enter so it sends the message. which does require you to be inside of the application you want to spam in and inside of whatever text box is used to send messages in.
# This is so stupid and not even that funny
yes i know, i'm just good with my priorties
if you for some reason check my code, do you really wanna steal this abomination? 
This code is bad on purpose i swear.
